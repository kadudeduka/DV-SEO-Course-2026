## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have Ahrefs access

**Symptoms:**
You can't access Ahrefs for backlink profile data.

**Solution:**
1. Use provided sample backlink data from course materials
2. Focus on understanding link evaluation frameworks
3. Note that Ahrefs would provide additional insights
4. Document that sample data was used

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The lab can be completed entirely with sample backlink data. Ahrefs is helpful but not required—sample data is sufficient for learning link evaluation.

---

### Issue: I don't understand the link quality framework

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about how to evaluate links using the framework.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 12 Chapter 1 for link quality framework details
2. Source Authority: Is the linking site authoritative? (Check domain age, content quality, other links)
3. Relevance: Is the link relevant? (Check topic alignment, audience match)
4. Context: Where does the link appear? (Editorial content is better than footer/sidebar)
5. Anchor Text: Is it natural? (Brand names, partial match, generic phrases are natural)
6. Placement: Where is the link? (Main content is better than footer/sidebar)

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the framework conceptually. The learning is in the evaluation process, not perfect link assessment.

---

### Issue: I can't determine if a source is authoritative

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about how to assess source authority.

**Solution:**
1. Review the linking website's content quality
2. Check if the site has other high-quality links pointing to it
3. Look for industry recognition or mentions
4. Assess domain age (older domains often have more authority)
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding authority assessment conceptually. The learning is in the evaluation process, not perfect authority measurement.
