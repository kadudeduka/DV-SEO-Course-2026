### Step 2: Categorize Issues

**What to Do:**
Categorize issues by type (technical, content, authority):

1. **Categorize technical issues:**
   - Crawlability issues (robots.txt, sitemap, status codes)
   - Indexation issues (noindex, canonical, exclusion)
   - Site structure issues (URL structure, architecture)
   - Technical implementation issues (mobile, speed, HTTPS)

2. **Categorize content issues:**
   - Content quality issues (thin content, low quality)
   - Content duplication issues (internal, external)
   - Content relevance issues
   - Content optimization issues (titles, meta, headings)

3. **Categorize authority issues:**
   - Link profile issues (low-quality links, manipulative patterns)
   - Authority signal gaps (citations, recognition, trust)
   - Link building issues

4. **Document categorization:**
   - Record categorized issues by type
   - Create categorization table
   - Note any uncategorized issues
   - Document categorization approach

**Tool to Use:**
Documentation Tool, Audit Data

**What to Record:**
Record issue categorization in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 1:

- Authority issues list
- Categorization summary

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have categorized all issues by type
- [ ] You have created categorization tables
- [ ] You have recorded categorization in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Distinguish Symptoms from Root Causes

**What to Do:**
For each issue, distinguish symptoms from root causes:

1. **Identify symptoms:**
   - Symptoms are surface problems (what you see)
   - Examples: "Page not indexed" (symptom), "Low traffic" (symptom)
   - Symptoms indicate problems but don't explain causes

2. **Identify root causes:**
   - Root causes are underlying issues (why the symptom exists)
   - Examples: "Blocked by robots.txt" (root cause of not indexed), "Technical crawl errors" (root cause of low traffic)
   - Root causes explain why symptoms occur

3. **Map symptoms to root causes:**
   - For each symptom, identify the root cause
   - One root cause may create multiple symptoms
   - Multiple root causes may contribute to one symptom
   - Create symptom-to-root-cause mapping

4. **Document distinction:**
   - Record symptoms identified
   - Record root causes identified
   - Create symptom-to-root-cause mapping
   - Document distinction reasoning

**Tool to Use:**
Documentation Tool, Day 15 Chapter 1

**What to Record:**
Record symptom vs root cause distinction in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 2:
- Symptoms identified
- Root causes identified
- Symptom-to-root-cause mapping
- Distinction reasoning

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have distinguished symptoms from root causes
- [ ] You have created symptom-to-root-cause mapping
- [ ] You have recorded distinction in the Submission Template

### Step 4: Prioritize Issues by Impact

**What to Do:**
Prioritize issues based on SEO impact:

1. **Assess impact:**
   - High impact: Issues that significantly affect SEO performance
   - Medium impact: Issues that moderately affect SEO performance
   - Low impact: Issues that minimally affect SEO performance

2. **Assess urgency:**
   - High urgency: Issues requiring immediate attention
   - Medium urgency: Issues requiring attention soon
   - Low urgency: Issues that can be addressed later

3. **Consider effort:**
   - High effort: Issues requiring significant resources to fix
   - Medium effort: Issues requiring moderate resources
   - Low effort: Issues requiring minimal resources

4. **Create prioritization:**
   - High impact, high urgency = Priority 1 (fix immediately)
   - High impact, medium urgency = Priority 2 (fix soon)
   - Medium impact, high urgency = Priority 2 (fix soon)
   - Lower priority issues follow similar logic

5. **Document prioritization:**
   - Record impact assessments
   - Record urgency assessments
   - Record effort assessments
   - Create prioritized issue list

**Tool to Use:**
Documentation Tool, Day 15 Chapter 1

**What to Record:**
Record prioritization in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Impact assessments (high, medium, low)
- Urgency assessments (high, medium, low)
- Effort assessments (high, medium, low)
- Prioritized issue list with priority rankings

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have assessed impact, urgency, and effort for all issues
- [ ] You have created prioritized issue list
- [ ] You have recorded prioritization in the Submission Template

---

### Step 5: Create Prioritized Fix List

**What to Do:**
Create a prioritized fix list with specific actions:

1. **Define fix actions:**
   - For each prioritized issue, define specific fix actions
   - Specify what needs to be done
   - Note resources needed
   - Define success criteria

2. **Organize by priority:**
   - Priority 1 fixes (high impact, high urgency)
   - Priority 2 fixes (high impact or high urgency)
   - Priority 3+ fixes (lower priority)

3. **Document fix list:**
   - Create prioritized fix list
   - Include issue, root cause, fix action, priority
   - Note expected impact of each fix
   - Create actionable fix plan

**Tool to Use:**
Documentation Tool

**What to Record:**
Record fix list in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Prioritized fix list
- Specific fix actions for each issue
- Priority rankings
- Expected impact assessments

**Checkpoint:**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have audit data from previous labs

**Symptoms:**
You haven't completed Day 14 labs or don't have audit data.

**Solution:**
1. Use provided sample audit data from course materials
2. Focus on understanding the isolation and prioritization framework
3. Note that using your own audit data would be more relevant
4. Document that sample data was used

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The lab can be completed using sample audit data. Sample data is sufficient for learning isolation and prioritization frameworks.

---

### Issue: I can't distinguish symptoms from root causes

**Symptoms:**
You're having trouble identifying root causes.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 15 Chapter 1 for symptom vs root cause guidance
2. Ask "why" questions: Why does this symptom exist?
3. Root cause: The underlying reason the symptom occurs
4. Symptom: The visible problem resulting from the root cause
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the distinction framework conceptually. The learning is in the isolation process, not perfect root cause identification.

---

### Issue: I'm not sure how to prioritize issues

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about prioritization criteria.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 15 Chapter 1 for prioritization guidance
2. Assess impact: How much does this issue affect SEO?
3. Assess urgency: How quickly does this need to be fixed?
4. Assess effort: How much work is required to fix it?
5. High impact + high urgency = high priority
6. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the prioritization framework conceptually. The learning is in the prioritization process, not perfect prioritization.
