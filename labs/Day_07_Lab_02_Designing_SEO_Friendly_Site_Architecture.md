## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I'm not sure which website type to choose

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain which website type to design for.

**Solution:**
1. Choose the type you're most familiar with or interested in
2. Blog is often simplest for learning
3. Corporate site offers good balance of complexity
4. Ecommerce is most complex but demonstrates advanced principles
5. The learning objective is understanding architecture design, not perfect execution

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Choose blog type—it's the most straightforward for learning architecture principles.

---

### Issue: I don't know how to create diagrams

**Symptoms:**
You're not comfortable with diagramming tools.

**Solution:**
1. Use simple text-based diagrams (boxes and arrows in text)
2. Draw on paper and take photos
3. Use basic shapes in any drawing tool
4. Focus on clarity over perfect design—the learning is in the thinking, not the diagram quality

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Create a text-based hierarchy using indentation or lists. The structure matters more than visual perfection.

---

### Issue: I'm not sure how to balance SEO and UX

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain how to balance competing needs.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 7 Chapter 2 for balance principles
2. Remember: Good architecture serves both—they're not always in conflict
3. When trade-offs exist, prioritize user experience (users come first, then optimize for search)
4. Document your thinking even if you're uncertain

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on creating logical, intuitive structure first (UX), then consider how it supports SEO. Logical structure usually supports both.
