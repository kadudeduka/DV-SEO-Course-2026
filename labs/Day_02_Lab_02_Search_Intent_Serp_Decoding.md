## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Select Queries to Analyze

**What to Do:**
Select 5-6 queries representing different intent types:
- **Informational query:** A question or "what is" query (e.g., "how to make coffee")
- **Navigational query:** A brand or website name (e.g., "facebook login")
- **Commercial query:** A "best" or comparison query (e.g., "best running shoes")
- **Transactional query:** A "buy" or purchase intent query (e.g., "buy laptop online")
- **Local query:** A location-based query (e.g., "coffee shops near me")
- **Additional query:** Choose one more query of any intent type

**Tool to Use:**
No tool needed for this step—just select queries.

**What to Record:**
Record your selected queries in the Submission Template, Section 1:
- List all 5-6 queries you will analyze
- Note your initial intent classification for each query (before analyzing SERPs)

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have selected 5-6 queries representing different intent types
- [ ] You have documented your selections in the Submission Template

---

### Step 2: Analyze SERP Components for Each Query

**What to Do:**
For each query, perform a Google search and systematically identify all SERP components:
1. Go to Google Search
2. Enter your query
3. Scroll through the entire first page of results
4. Identify all components present:
   - Organic results (blue links)
   - Paid ads (marked with "Ad")
   - Featured snippets (answer boxes)
   - People Also Ask (expandable questions)
   - Image results (image carousels)
   - Video results (video carousels)
   - Local pack (map with businesses)
   - Knowledge panels (entity information boxes)
   - Related searches (bottom of page)
   - Any other components

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search

**What to Record:**
Record your observations in the Submission Template, Section 2:
- For each query, list all SERP components present
- Note the position of each component (top, middle, bottom, side)
- Take screenshots or detailed notes of each SERP

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed SERPs for all 5-6 queries
- [ ] You have identified all components present for each query
- [ ] You have documented your observations in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Classify Search Intent for Each Query

**What to Do:**
Based on your SERP analysis, classify the search intent for each query:
1. Review the SERP components you identified
2. Analyze what content types rank in organic results
3. Consider what the SERP composition signals about user intent
4. Classify intent as: Informational, Navigational, Commercial, or Transactional
5. Note if the intent is clear or mixed

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your SERP analysis and understanding from the chapters.

**What to Record:**
Record your intent classifications in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Intent classification for each query
- Evidence supporting your classification (SERP components, content types)
- Note if your initial classification matched the SERP analysis

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have classified intent for all queries
- [ ] You have documented evidence supporting each classification
- [ ] You have noted any differences between initial assumptions and SERP analysis

---

### Step 4: Analyze Intent Signals from SERP Components

**What to Do:**
For each query, analyze what each SERP component signals about intent:
1. Review the SERP components present
2. Consider what each component type typically signals:
   - Featured snippets + People Also Ask → Informational intent
   - Product carousels + Shopping results → Commercial/transactional intent
   - Local pack → Local intent
   - Images/Videos prominent → Visual/video intent
3. Document how components signal intent for each query

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your observations and understanding.

**What to Record:**
Record your analysis in the Submission Template, Section 4:
- For each query, document what each SERP component signals about intent
- Explain how component presence reveals user intent
- Note patterns you observe across queries

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed intent signals for all queries
- [ ] You have documented how components signal intent
- [ ] You have identified patterns across queries

---

### Step 5: Identify Content Opportunities

**What to Do:**
Based on your SERP analysis, identify content opportunities:
1. Review SERP features present (featured snippets, People Also Ask, images, videos, etc.)
2. Consider what content types you could create to target these features
3. Identify opportunities based on SERP gaps or features
4. Document actionable opportunities for each query

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your SERP analysis.

**What to Record:**
Record your opportunities in the Submission Template, Section 5:
- Content opportunities identified for each query
- SERP features you could target
- Content types that would match the intent

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified content opportunities for all queries
- [ ] You have documented opportunities in the Submission Template
- [ ] You have connected opportunities to SERP features

---

### Step 6: Compare SERPs Across Intent Types

**What to Do:**
Compare SERPs across different intent types to identify patterns:
1. Compare informational query SERPs with commercial query SERPs
2. Compare transactional query SERPs with navigational query SERPs
3. Identify patterns in component presence across intent types
4. Note how SERP composition differs by intent

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your documented observations.

**What to Record:**
Record your comparison in the Submission Template, Section 6:
- Patterns observed across intent types
- How SERP composition differs by intent
- Insights about intent-SERP relationships

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have compared SERPs across intent types
- [ ] You have identified patterns and differences
- [ ] You have documented your comparison in the Submission Template

- Look on the right side for knowledge panels (desktop)
- Review Chapter 2 for a complete list of SERP components

### Issue: Intent classification is unclear

**Solution:**
- Focus on what content types rank in organic results
- Consider what SERP features are present
- Review Chapter 3 for intent classification guidelines
- Remember that some queries have mixed intent—note this in your analysis

### Issue: Don't understand how components signal intent

**Solution:**
- Review Chapter 2 section on SERP components and intent signals
- Review Chapter 3 section on intent categories
- Consider what each component type typically appears for
- Look for patterns across multiple queries
