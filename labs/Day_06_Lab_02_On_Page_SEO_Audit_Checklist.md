## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have multiple pages to audit

**Symptoms:**
Your WordPress blog doesn't have 3-5 different pages.

**Solution:**
1. Audit the pages you have (even if fewer than 3)
2. Create additional pages or posts for auditing practice
3. Use provided example pages if available
4. Focus on learning the audit process rather than having perfect pages

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Contact your instructor for provided example pages you can audit.

---

### Issue: I'm not sure what to look for in the checklist

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about what constitutes an "issue" for each checklist item.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 6 Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 for best practices
2. Compare your pages with well-optimized examples (search for similar content)
3. Use browser inspection to see how elements are structured
4. When in doubt, document what you observe—the learning is in the process

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on the most obvious issues first (missing alt text, poor heading structure, missing meta descriptions). You'll learn to identify subtler issues with practice.

---

### Issue: I can't determine impact levels

**Symptoms:**
You're unsure how to assess whether an issue is high, medium, or low impact.

**Solution:**
1. High Impact: Issues that prevent search engines from understanding content or significantly hurt user experience (missing title, no alt text, poor heading structure)
2. Medium Impact: Issues that reduce optimization effectiveness (suboptimal titles, weak meta descriptions)
3. Low Impact: Issues that are minor optimizations (slightly long titles, minor formatting)

**If This Doesn't Work:**
When in doubt, prioritize issues that affect accessibility or core SEO elements (titles, headings, images). These typically have higher impact.
