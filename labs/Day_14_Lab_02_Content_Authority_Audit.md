## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have Ahrefs access

**Symptoms:**
You can't access Ahrefs for link profile analysis.

**Solution:**
1. Use provided sample link data from course materials
2. Focus on understanding link profile analysis frameworks
3. Note that Ahrefs would provide additional insights
4. Document that sample data was used

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The audit can be completed using sample link data. Ahrefs is helpful but not required—sample data is sufficient for learning link profile analysis.

---

### Issue: I can't find duplicate content

**Symptoms:**
You're having trouble identifying duplicate content.

**Solution:**
1. Compare content across your own pages
   - Look for similar or identical content
   - Check for duplicate title tags or meta descriptions
2. Use Google Search to check for external duplication
   - Search for unique content snippets
   - Check if content appears elsewhere
3. Focus on understanding the duplication check process
4. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the content audit framework conceptually. The learning is in the audit process, not perfect duplication identification.

---

### Issue: I don't understand how to evaluate authority signals

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about how to assess authority signals.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 14 Chapter 1 for authority signal guidance
2. Authority signals include: citations, mentions, recognition, trust signals
3. Look for evidence of authority building
4. Compare with competitors if possible
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the authority audit framework conceptually. The learning is in the audit process, not perfect authority measurement.
