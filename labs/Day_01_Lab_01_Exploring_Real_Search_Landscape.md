- **Commercial query:** A "best" or comparison query (e.g., "best running shoes")
- **Navigational query:** A brand or website name (e.g., "facebook login")
- **Transactional query:** A "buy" or purchase intent query (e.g., "buy laptop online")
- **Local query:** A location-based query (e.g., "coffee shops near me")
- **How-to query:** An instructional query (e.g., "how to fix leaky faucet")

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search

**What to Record:**
Record your selected queries in the Submission Template, Section 1:
- List all 4-6 queries you will analyze
- Note the intent type for each query

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] You have selected 4-6 different queries
- [ ] Your queries represent at least 4 different intent types
- [ ] Your queries are recorded in the Submission Template

---

### Step 2: Perform Searches and Capture SERP Screenshots

**What to Do:**
For each query, perform a Google search and take a screenshot of the first page of results. Make sure your screenshot captures:
- The entire first page of results (scroll if needed)
- All visible SERP components (organic results, ads, features, etc.)
- The search query in the search box

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search

**What to Record:**
Record your screenshots in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 1:
- Attach one screenshot per query (4-6 screenshots total)
- Label each screenshot with the query and intent type

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have screenshots for all 4-6 queries
- [ ] Each screenshot shows the complete first page of results
- [ ] All screenshots are attached in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Identify SERP Components

**What to Do:**
For each SERP screenshot, systematically identify and document all visible components:
- **Organic results:** Traditional blue link listings
- **Paid ads:** Sponsored listings (usually at top or bottom)
- **Featured snippets:** Direct answers in boxes
- **People Also Ask:** Expandable question sections
- **Image results:** Image carousels or image packs
- **Video results:** Video carousels or video sections
- **Local pack:** Map with local business listings
- **Knowledge panel:** Information box on the right side
- **Related searches:** Links at the bottom

**Tool to Use:**
Your SERP screenshots from Step 2

**What to Record:**
Record your findings in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 2:
- Create a table listing each query and all SERP components you identified
- Note the position of each component (top, middle, bottom, side)

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified all SERP components for each query
- [ ] Your findings are documented in the Submission Template table
- [ ] You can see differences in SERP layouts across query types

---

### Step 4: Analyze Zero-Click Search Elements

**What to Do:**
Review each SERP to identify zero-click search elements—components that provide answers directly on the SERP without requiring a click:
- Featured snippets with direct answers
- Knowledge panels with information
- Calculator or converter results
- Weather widgets
- Direct answer boxes

For each zero-click element, note what information is provided and whether it fully answers the query.

**Tool to Use:**
Your SERP screenshots and observations

**What to Record:**
Record your observations in the Submission Template, Section 4:
- List all zero-click elements you found
- Note which queries had zero-click elements
- Describe what information each zero-click element provided

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified zero-click elements in your SERPs
- [ ] You understand how zero-click elements provide visibility without clicks
- [ ] Your observations are recorded in the Submission Template

---

### Step 5: Compare SERP Layouts Across Query Types

**What to Do:**
Analyze how different query types produce different SERP layouts. Compare:
- Which query types show paid ads
- Which query types show featured snippets
- Which query types show local results
- Which query types show image or video results
- How organic results differ across query types

**Tool to Use:**
Your documented observations from Steps 3 and 4

**What to Record:**
Record your analysis in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Write a comparison analysis (2-3 paragraphs) describing how different query types produce different SERP layouts
- Note patterns you observe (e.g., commercial queries often show ads, informational queries often show featured snippets)

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified patterns in SERP layouts across query types
- [ ] You can explain how query type influences SERP layout
- [ ] Your comparison analysis is written in the Submission Template

---

### Step 6: Identify Intent Signals in SERPs

**What to Do:**
For each query, analyze how the SERP layout signals search intent. Consider:
- What does the presence of paid ads suggest about intent?
- What does the presence of featured snippets suggest about intent?
- What does the presence of product results suggest about intent?
- What does the presence of local results suggest about intent?

Match each SERP's components to the intent type you identified in Step 1.

**Tool to Use:**
Your SERP analysis from previous steps

**What to Record:**
Record your intent signal analysis in the Submission Template, Section 5:
- For each query, identify how SERP components signal intent
- Note whether the SERP components match the intent type you identified
- Document any insights about how search engines signal intent through SERP layout

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed intent signals for all queries
- [ ] You understand how SERP components signal user intent
- [ ] Your intent signal analysis is recorded in the Submission Template

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: SERP Components Look Different Than Expected

**Symptoms:**
Your SERP doesn't show the components mentioned in the lab, or components appear in different positions.

**Solution:**
- SERPs vary based on location, device, and personalization
- Focus on identifying what components ARE present, not what's missing
- Note any variations you observe—this is valuable learning
- If needed, try incognito/private browsing mode to reduce personalization

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Different SERP layouts are normal and part of understanding search
- Document what you see, even if it differs from examples
- Your observations are valid regardless of specific component presence

---

### Issue: Can't Identify Intent Type for a Query

**Symptoms:**
You're unsure whether a query is informational, commercial, transactional, or navigational.

**Solution:**
- Review Chapter 2's intent categories section
- Ask: "What is the user trying to do?" (learn, buy, find, compare)
- Look at the SERP itself—the components often signal intent
- If still unsure, note your reasoning in the Submission Template

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Intent identification improves with practice
- Your best judgment is sufficient for this lab
- Focus on observing SERP differences, not perfect intent classification

---

### Issue: Screenshots Are Too Large or Unclear

**Symptoms:**
Screenshots are difficult to read or file sizes are too large.

**Solution:**
- Use your device's screenshot tool (not camera photos)
- Crop screenshots to focus on the SERP area
- Save screenshots in compressed format (JPG) if file size is an issue
- Ensure text is readable before attaching

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Contact your instructor for alternative submission methods
- Consider using screen annotation tools to highlight key components

---

### Issue: Submission Template Sections Don't Match Lab Steps

**Symptoms:**
You're unsure which Submission Template section corresponds to which lab step.

**Solution:**
- Review the Submission Template structure
- Lab steps explicitly reference Submission Template sections
- Section 2 is for evidence (screenshots, tables)
- Section 3 is for analysis (comparison, interpretation)
- Section 4 is for zero-click observations
- Section 5 is for intent signal analysis

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Record your work in the most appropriate section
- You can add notes explaining where evidence is located
- Contact your instructor if you need clarification
