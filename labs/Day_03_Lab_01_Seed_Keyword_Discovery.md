### Step 1: Select Your Niche

**What to Do:**
Select a niche for keyword research. Choose a niche you're familiar with or interested in:

### Step 2: Brainstorm Initial Seed Keywords

**What to Do:**
Based on your niche understanding, brainstorm 5-10 initial seed keyword ideas:
1. Think about the core topics in your niche
2. Consider what people might search for when interested in this niche
3. Write down broad, core keywords (not long-tail variations)
4. Focus on keywords that represent the main topics or services

**Tool to Use:**
No tool needed—use your knowledge of the niche.

**What to Record:**
Record your brainstormed keywords in the Submission Template, Section 2:
- List of 5-10 initial seed keyword ideas
- Brief note on why you think each might be a seed keyword

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have brainstormed 5-10 initial seed keyword ideas
- [ ] You have documented them in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Validate with Google Autocomplete

**What to Do:**
Use Google Autocomplete to validate and discover seed keywords:
1. Go to Google Search
2. Type each of your brainstormed keywords
3. Observe what Google suggests (autocomplete suggestions)
4. Note which suggestions reveal core topics (these are seed keywords)
5. Discover new seed keywords from autocomplete suggestions

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search (Autocomplete)

**What to Record:**
Record your findings in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Which brainstormed keywords generated relevant autocomplete suggestions
- New seed keywords discovered from autocomplete
- Patterns you observed in autocomplete suggestions

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have validated brainstormed keywords with autocomplete
- [ ] You have discovered additional seed keywords from autocomplete
- [ ] You have documented your findings in the Submission Template

---

### Step 4: Observe Competitor Keywords

**What to Do:**
Identify 2-3 competitor websites in your niche and observe what keywords they target:
1. Search for your niche + "best" or niche + "top" to find competitor websites
2. Visit competitor websites
3. Observe their page titles, headings, and content topics
4. Identify what core keywords they're targeting
5. Note which keywords appear to be their seed keywords

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search and competitor websites

**What to Record:**
Record your observations in the Submission Template, Section 4:
- Competitor websites analyzed
- Seed keywords you identified from competitor observation
- Patterns you noticed across competitors

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed 2-3 competitor websites
- [ ] You have identified seed keywords from competitor observation
- [ ] You have documented your observations in the Submission Template

### Step 5: Finalize Your Seed Keyword List

**What to Do:**
Combine keywords from all three methods to create your final seed keyword list:
1. Review keywords from brainstorming, autocomplete, and competitor observation
2. Select 5-7 core seed keywords that represent the main topics in your niche
3. Ensure each seed keyword is broad enough to expand but specific enough to be meaningful
4. Justify why each keyword is a seed keyword

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your compiled findings.

**What to Record:**
Record your final seed keyword list in the Submission Template, Section 5:
- Final list of 5-7 seed keywords
- Justification for each seed keyword (why it's a core starting point)
- Which method(s) led to each keyword

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have finalized 5-7 seed keywords
- [ ] You have justified each seed keyword

### Step 6: Reflect on Demand Discovery Approach

**What to Do:**
Reflect on how this process demonstrates demand discovery:
1. Consider how using multiple methods revealed actual user demand
2. Think about how this differs from just using a tool to find high-volume keywords
3. Reflect on what you learned about your niche's actual search demand

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your experience and understanding.

**What to Record:**
Record your reflection in the Submission Template, Section 6:

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't think of seed keywords

**Solution:**
