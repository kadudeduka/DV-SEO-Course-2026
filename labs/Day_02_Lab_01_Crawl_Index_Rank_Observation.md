## Tools & Resources

### Primary Tools

**Google Search (with site: operator)**
- **Purpose:** Google Search with the site: operator enables you to observe which pages are indexed for real websites. By analyzing indexing status, you'll understand how search engines store and process pages, reinforcing the crawl-index-rank sequence.
- **Access:** Free, accessible via any web browser at google.com
- **Note:** The site: operator shows only indexed pages. Use format: `site:example.com` to see all indexed pages for a domain.

### Alternative Tools

If Google Search is unavailable, you can use:
- Bing Search — Similar site: operator functionality
- DuckDuckGo — Different interface but can be used for comparison

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Select Websites to Analyze

**What to Do:**
Select 2-3 real websites to analyze. Choose websites you're familiar with or can easily access:
- A blog or content website
- A business or corporate website
- An ecommerce website (optional)

**Tool to Use:**
No tool needed for this step—just select websites.

- Note the website type for each (blog, business, ecommerce)

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have selected 2-3 websites to analyze
- [ ] You have documented your selections in the Submission Template

---

### Step 2: Observe Indexed Pages Using site: Operator

**What to Do:**
For each website, use Google Search with the site: operator to see which pages are indexed:
1. Go to Google Search
2. Type `site:example.com` (replace example.com with your selected website)
3. Review the results to see which pages appear
4. Note how many pages are indexed (check if Google shows "About X results")
5. Look at the types of pages that appear (homepage, blog posts, product pages, etc.)

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search with site: operator

**What to Record:**
Record your observations in the Submission Template, Section 2:
- For each website, list which pages appear in search results (indexed pages)
- Note the types of pages that are indexed
- Document the approximate number of indexed pages (if shown)

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have used site: operator for all selected websites
- [ ] You have documented which pages are indexed for each website
- [ ] You have noted the types of pages that appear

---

### Step 3: Identify Non-Indexed Pages

**What to Do:**
For each website, try to identify pages that might exist but are NOT indexed:
1. Visit the website directly
2. Navigate through the site to find pages (about page, contact page, blog posts, product pages, etc.)
3. Use site: operator to check if specific pages are indexed (e.g., `site:example.com/about`)
4. Document pages that exist on the website but don't appear in search results

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search with site: operator, plus direct website navigation

**What to Record:**
Record your findings in the Submission Template, Section 2:
- List pages that exist on the website but are NOT indexed
- Note why these pages might not be indexed (consider: noindex tags, blocked by robots.txt, low quality, duplicate content, etc.)

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified at least some pages that exist but are not indexed
- [ ] You have documented these findings in the Submission Template
- [ ] You have considered reasons why pages might not be indexed

---

### Step 4: Analyze the Crawl-Index-Rank Sequence

**What to Do:**
Based on your observations, analyze how the crawl-index-rank sequence applies to your selected websites:
1. **Crawl Stage:** Consider how search engines might have discovered these pages (through links, sitemaps, etc.)
2. **Index Stage:** Document which pages made it to the index (the pages you see with site: operator)
3. **Rank Stage:** Consider how these indexed pages might rank for different search queries

Create a visual representation or written explanation of the crawl-index-rank sequence for one of your websites.

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your observations and understanding from the chapters.

**What to Record:**
Record your analysis in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Visual representation or written explanation of crawl-index-rank sequence
- Analysis of how each stage applies to your observed websites
- Connection between your observations and the three-stage process

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have created a visual or written representation of the crawl-index-rank sequence
- [ ] You have connected your observations to the three-stage process
- [ ] You have documented this in the Submission Template

### Step 5: Reflect on Technical Accessibility

**What to Do:**
Reflect on how technical accessibility affects search visibility based on your observations:
1. Consider why some pages are indexed while others are not
2. Think about what technical factors might prevent pages from being crawled or indexed
3. Reflect on what this means for SEO strategy

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your observations and understanding.

**What to Record:**
Record your reflection in the Submission Template, Section 4:
- Analysis of why certain pages might not be indexed
- Reflection on how technical accessibility affects visibility
- Insights about what this means for SEO

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have reflected on technical accessibility factors
- [ ] You have documented your insights in the Submission Template
- [ ] You have connected your observations to SEO strategy

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: site: operator shows no results

**Possible Causes:**
- The website might not be indexed at all
- You might have typed the domain incorrectly
- The website might be very new

**Solution:**
- Double-check the domain spelling
- Try searching for the website's homepage directly
- Consider selecting a different, more established website

### Issue: Can't identify non-indexed pages

**Possible Causes:**
- The website might have all pages indexed
- You might not be familiar enough with the website structure

**Solution:**
- Try navigating the website more thoroughly
- Look for pages like "About", "Contact", "Privacy Policy" that might not be indexed
- Consider that some websites do have all pages indexed (this is also a valid observation)

### Issue: Don't understand the crawl-index-rank sequence

**Solution:**
- Re-read Chapter 1, focusing on the three-stage process section
- Review the visual in Chapter 1 showing the crawl-index-rank flow
- Remember: Crawl = discover, Index = store, Rank = order for search results
