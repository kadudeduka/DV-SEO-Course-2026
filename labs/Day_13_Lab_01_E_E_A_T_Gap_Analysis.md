## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have enough content on my WordPress blog

**Symptoms:**
Your WordPress blog doesn't have enough pages to analyze.

**Solution:**
1. Analyze available pages even if there are only a few
2. Use provided website examples for additional practice
3. Focus on understanding the E-E-A-T analysis framework
4. Document that you used provided examples if needed

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Contact your instructor for provided website examples you can use for E-E-A-T analysis practice.

---

### Issue: I can't find author information

**Symptoms:**
You're having trouble finding author bios or credentials.

**Solution:**
1. Check for author bylines on articles
2. Look for "About" or "Authors" pages
3. Check footer or sidebar for author information
4. If missing, document this as a trust signal gap
5. Note that missing author information is a common gap

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the E-E-A-T analysis framework conceptually. The learning is in the analysis process, not perfect trust signal identification.

---

### Issue: I don't understand how to evaluate authority

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about how to assess authority signals.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 13 Chapter 1 for authority dimension details
2. Authority is built over time through consistent quality
3. Look for citations, mentions, or recognition from others
4. Check if the website is cited as a source
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the E-E-A-T analysis framework conceptually. The learning is in the analysis process, not perfect authority measurement.
