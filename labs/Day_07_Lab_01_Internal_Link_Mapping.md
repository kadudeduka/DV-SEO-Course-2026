## Tools & Resources

### Primary Tools

**WordPress Blog Editor**
- **Purpose:** WordPress enables you to access your blog pages and analyze internal linking. By reviewing your actual blog structure, you'll understand how internal links connect pages and identify linking patterns in real content.
- **Access:** Your WordPress blog (required per course setup)
- **Note:** If you don't have enough pages, you can analyze the pages you have or use provided examples.

**Browser Developer Tools**
- **Purpose:** Browser developer tools enable you to inspect HTML and identify internal links on pages. By inspecting link elements, you'll understand how internal links are structured and how they connect pages.
- **Access:** Built into all modern browsers (right-click → Inspect or F12)
- **Note:** Basic inspection for link elements is sufficient.

**Spreadsheet or Document Tool**
- **Purpose:** Spreadsheet or document tools enable you to create link maps and track internal linking patterns. By documenting links systematically, you'll visualize link structure and identify patterns.
- **Access:** Free (Google Sheets, Excel, or any document tool)
- **Note:** Manual mapping helps you understand link structure even if automated tools aren't available.

### Alternative Tools

If WordPress is unavailable, you can use:
- Any CMS/blog platform — Similar page access
- Browser inspection tools — Universal across platforms
- Provided website examples — If your own site is not available

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Select Pages to Map

**What to Do:**
Select 10-15 pages from your WordPress blog to map internal links. Choose pages that:
- Represent different content types (blog posts, pages, category pages if available)
- Have varying link patterns (some may have many links, others few)
- Are accessible for analysis
- Cover different topics or sections

If you don't have 10-15 pages, select all available pages or use provided examples.

**Tool to Use:**
WordPress Blog Editor

**What to Record:**
Record your selections in the Submission Template, Section 1:
- List of pages selected (titles, URLs, content types)
- Why you selected these pages
- Initial observations about page structure

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have selected 10-15 pages (or all available pages)
- [ ] You have recorded selections in the Submission Template
- [ ] You have noted initial observations

---

### Step 2: Map Internal Links Systematically

**What to Do:**
For each selected page, identify all internal links:
1. Open each page in browser
2. Use browser inspection to find all internal links (`<a>` tags with internal URLs)
3. Document which pages link to which pages
4. Create a link map (spreadsheet or document):
   - Column 1: Source page (page with the link)
   - Column 2: Target page (page being linked to)
   - Column 3: Link count (how many links from source to target)
   - Column 4: Link context (where link appears: content, navigation, footer, etc.)

Create a systematic map of all internal links.

**Tool to Use:**
Browser Developer Tools, Spreadsheet/Document Tool

**What to Record:**
Record your link map in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 1:
- Link map spreadsheet or document
- Screenshots showing link inspection
- Summary of total links mapped
- Note on mapping methodology

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have mapped internal links for all selected pages
- [ ] You have created a link map document
- [ ] You have documented mapping in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Identify Orphan Pages

**What to Do:**
Analyze your link map to identify orphan pages:
1. Review link map to find pages that receive NO internal links
2. These are orphan pages—pages that search engines may struggle to discover
3. Document all orphan pages found
4. Note why these pages might be orphaned (new content, isolated topics, etc.)

**Tool to Use:**
Link Map (from Step 2)

**What to Record:**
Record orphan page identification in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 2:
- List of all orphan pages identified
- Why each page might be orphaned
- Impact assessment (how being orphaned affects each page)
- Screenshots showing pages with no internal links

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified all orphan pages
- [ ] You have documented why pages are orphaned
- [ ] You have recorded findings in the Submission Template

---

### Step 4: Identify Overlinked Pages

**What to Do:**
Analyze your link map to identify overlinked pages:
1. Review link map to find pages that have TOO MANY internal links (50+ links on a single page)
2. These are overlinked pages—pages that may dilute link equity
3. Document all overlinked pages found
4. Note why these pages might be overlinked (navigation menus, footer links, content links, etc.)

**Tool to Use:**
Link Map (from Step 2), Browser Developer Tools

**What to Record:**
Record overlinked page identification in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 3:
- List of all overlinked pages identified
- Link count for each overlinked page
- Why each page might be overlinked
- Impact assessment (how being overlinked affects each page)
- Screenshots showing pages with excessive links

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified all overlinked pages
- [ ] You have documented link counts and reasons
- [ ] You have recorded findings in the Submission Template

---

### Step 5: Analyze Link Distribution Patterns

**What to Do:**
Analyze your link map to identify link distribution patterns:
1. Identify which pages receive the most internal links (link equity recipients)
2. Identify which pages link out the most (link equity distributors)
3. Identify link clusters (groups of pages that link to each other)
4. Identify gaps in link distribution (important pages with few links)
5. Document distribution patterns and imbalances

**Tool to Use:**
Link Map (from Step 2)

**What to Record:**
Record link distribution analysis in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Pages receiving most internal links (top 5)
- Pages linking out most (top 5)
- Link clusters identified
- Distribution gaps identified
- Analysis of link equity flow patterns

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed link distribution patterns
- [ ] You have identified equity recipients and distributors
- [ ] You have documented patterns in the Submission Template

---

### Step 6: Document Internal Linking Issues

**What to Do:**
Summarize all internal linking issues found:
1. Compile all issues: orphan pages, overlinked pages, distribution gaps
2. Categorize issues by type and severity
3. Assess impact of each issue type
4. Create prioritized list of issues to address

**Tool to Use:**
Link Map, Analysis from previous steps

**What to Record:**
Record issue documentation in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- Complete list of internal linking issues
- Categorization by type (orphan, overlinked, distribution gap)
- Severity assessment for each issue
- Prioritized list of issues to address
- Recommendations for fixing each issue type

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have documented all internal linking issues
- [ ] You have categorized and prioritized issues
- [ ] You have recorded findings in the Submission Template

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have 10-15 pages to map

**Symptoms:**
Your WordPress blog doesn't have enough pages for mapping.

**Solution:**
1. Map all available pages (even if fewer than 10)
2. Create additional pages or posts for mapping practice
3. Use provided example websites if available
4. Focus on learning the mapping process rather than having perfect page counts

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Contact your instructor for provided example websites you can map.

---

### Issue: Manual link mapping is time-consuming

**Symptoms:**
Mapping links manually takes a long time.

**Solution:**
1. Start with a smaller subset of pages (5-7 pages)
2. Focus on understanding the mapping process
3. Use browser inspection to identify links efficiently
4. Document links as you find them to avoid rework

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The learning objective is understanding link structure, not perfect mapping. Focus on mapping enough pages to understand patterns (5-7 pages is sufficient).

---

### Issue: I can't identify what makes a page "overlinked"

**Symptoms:**
You're unsure how many links is "too many."

**Solution:**
1. Generally, pages with 50+ internal links may be overlinked
2. Consider context: navigation menus and footers naturally have many links
3. Focus on content area links—if content has 20+ internal links, that might be excessive
4. Compare pages: if one page has significantly more links than others, investigate why

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on identifying pages with unusually high link counts compared to other pages. The exact number matters less than understanding the pattern.
