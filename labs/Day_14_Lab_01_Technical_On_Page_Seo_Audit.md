## Tools & Resources

### Primary Tools

**WordPress Blog**
- **Purpose:** Your WordPress blog enables you to perform a real technical and on-page SEO audit. By auditing your own website, you'll understand how to conduct structured audits and identify technical and on-page issues systematically.
- **Access:** Your WordPress blog (required per course setup)
- **Note:** If you don't have enough content, you can analyze provided website examples.

**Browser Developer Tools**
- **Purpose:** Browser developer tools enable you to inspect pages, check HTML structure, verify technical elements, and understand how search engines see pages. By inspecting pages, you'll identify technical and on-page issues.
- **Access:** Built into all modern browsers
- **Note:** Basic inspection for HTML tags and page structure is sufficient.

**Google Search Console (If Available)**
- **Purpose:** Google Search Console provides technical audit data including crawl errors, indexation issues, and performance data. By analyzing GSC data, you'll identify technical problems that affect SEO.
- **Access:** Free, if available (requires Google account and website verification)
- **Note:** If GSC is not available, you can complete the audit using browser tools and manual checks.

**Google Search (site: operator)**
- **Purpose:** Google Search with site: operator enables you to check which pages are indexed and identify indexation patterns. By using site:yourdomain.com, you'll understand indexation status.
- **Access:** Free, accessible via any web browser
- **Note:** This helps identify indexation issues even without GSC.

### Alternative Tools

If WordPress blog is unavailable, you can use:
- Provided website examples — For audit practice
- Public websites — For audit practice
- Generic website examples — For learning audit framework

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have Google Search Console access

**Symptoms:**
You can't access GSC for audit data.

**Solution:**
1. Complete the audit using browser tools and Google Search site: operator
2. Focus on understanding the audit framework
3. Note that GSC would provide additional insights
4. Document that GSC was not available

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The audit can be completed using browser tools and manual checks. GSC is helpful but not required—manual auditing is sufficient for learning audit frameworks.

---

### Issue: I can't distinguish root causes from symptoms

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about what constitutes a root cause vs symptom.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 14 Chapter 1 for root cause vs symptom guidance
2. Root cause: Underlying issue that creates the problem
3. Symptom: Surface problem that results from root cause
4. Example: "Page not indexed" is symptom, "Blocked by robots.txt" is root cause
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the audit framework conceptually. The learning is in the audit process, not perfect root cause identification.

---

### Issue: I'm not sure how to prioritize issues

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about how to prioritize audit findings.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 14 Chapter 1 for prioritization guidance
2. Assess impact: How much does this issue affect SEO?
3. Assess effort: How much work is needed to fix it?
4. High impact, low effort = high priority
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the prioritization framework conceptually. The learning is in the prioritization process, not perfect prioritization.
