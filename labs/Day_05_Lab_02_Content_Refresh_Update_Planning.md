## Tools & Resources

### Primary Tools

**WordPress Blog Editor**
- **Purpose:** WordPress enables you to access and analyze older blog posts. By reviewing older content, you'll identify decay factors and make strategic decisions about content maintenance, applying the update vs replace framework from Day 5 Chapter 2.
- **Access:** Your WordPress blog (required per course setup)
- **Note:** If you don't have older posts, you can analyze newer posts and imagine they're older, or use provided examples.

**Google Search Console (Optional)**
- **Purpose:** Google Search Console provides performance data (impressions, clicks, rankings) that helps identify content decay. By analyzing performance trends, you'll understand which content is declining and why, enabling strategic refresh decisions.
- **Access:** Free, if available (requires Google account and website verification)
- **Note:** If GSC is not available, you can complete the lab using content analysis alone. Performance data is helpful but not required.

**Browser Tools**
- **Purpose:** Browser tools enable you to analyze content structure, check for outdated information, and compare content with current standards. By inspecting content and researching current information, you'll identify what needs updating.
- **Access:** Built into all modern browsers
- **Note:** Basic browser usage for content review and research is sufficient.

### Alternative Tools

If WordPress is unavailable, you can use:
- Any CMS/blog platform — Similar content access
- Google Docs or other content platforms — For analysis practice
- Provided example content — If your own content is not available

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Select Older Content for Analysis

**What to Do:**
Select 3-5 older blog posts from your WordPress blog to analyze. Choose posts that:
- Are at least 6 months old (or older if available)
- Cover topics that may have evolved
- Have varying performance (some may have declined, others stable)
- Represent different content types (how-to, informational, comparison, etc.)

If you don't have older posts, select your oldest posts or use provided examples. The goal is to practice content analysis and refresh planning.

**Tool to Use:**
WordPress Blog Editor

**What to Record:**
Record your selections in the Submission Template, Section 1:
- List of 3-5 posts selected (titles, URLs, publication dates)
- Why you selected each post
- Initial observations about each post

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have selected 3-5 older posts
- [ ] You have recorded selections in the Submission Template
- [ ] You have noted initial observations

---

### Step 2: Analyze Content Decay Factors

**What to Do:**
For each selected post, analyze decay factors using the framework from Day 5 Chapter 2:

1. **Competition Analysis:**
   - Search for the post's primary keyword/topic
   - Compare your content with current top-ranking content
   - Identify if competitors have more comprehensive content
   - Note if competition has improved

2. **Information Currency:**
   - Check if statistics, data, or facts are outdated
   - Verify if examples or case studies are current
   - Identify if information has changed since publication
   - Note if topic has evolved

3. **Algorithm Alignment:**
   - Assess if content meets current SEO standards
   - Check formatting and structure quality
   - Evaluate user experience factors
   - Note if content aligns with current best practices

4. **User Expectations:**
   - Consider if content depth meets current expectations
   - Assess if format is still appropriate
   - Evaluate if content answers current user questions
   - Note if expectations have evolved

**Tool to Use:**
Browser (for searching and comparing), WordPress Blog Editor (for reviewing content)

**What to Record:**
Record your analysis in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 1:
- For each post, document:
  - Competition analysis findings
  - Information currency assessment
  - Algorithm alignment evaluation
  - User expectations analysis
- Screenshots of comparison searches (if helpful)
- Summary of decay factors identified

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed all selected posts for decay factors
- [ ] You have documented competition, currency, algorithm, and expectation factors
- [ ] You have recorded findings in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Apply Update vs Replace Decision Framework

**What to Do:**
For each analyzed post, apply the update vs replace decision framework from Day 5 Chapter 2:

**Update existing content when:**
- Core topic remains relevant and valuable
- Strategic updates can address gaps or outdated information
- Content structure is sound and can be improved
- URL already has value (backlinks, ranking history, traffic)

**Replace content when:**
- Topic is fundamentally outdated or no longer relevant
- Content structure is poor and unfixable
- URL has negative signals (penalties, poor reputation)
- Creating new content is more efficient than updating

For each post, make a decision (Update or Replace) and document your reasoning.

**Tool to Use:**
WordPress Blog Editor, Browser (for research)

**What to Record:**
Record your decisions in the Submission Template, Section 2, Evidence Item 2:
- Create a decision matrix for each post:
  - Decision: Update or Replace
  - Reasoning for decision
  - Factors considered (topic relevance, structure quality, URL value, etc.)
  - Confidence level in decision

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have applied the framework to all posts

   - Consider impact (how much will this improve visibility?)
   - Consider effort (how much work is required?)
   - Consider urgency (is content declining rapidly?)

2. **Create Prioritized List:**
   - High priority, high impact updates first
   - Medium priority updates next
   - Low priority updates last

3. **Estimate Overall Timeline:**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have older blog posts to analyze

**Symptoms:**
Your blog is new and doesn't have posts older than 6 months.

**Solution:**
1. Analyze your oldest posts, even if they're not 6 months old
2. Imagine they're older and analyze what would need updating
3. Use provided example content if available
4. Focus on learning the analysis framework rather than having perfect old content

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Contact your instructor for provided example content you can analyze.

---

### Issue: I don't have Google Search Console access

**Symptoms:**
You can't access performance data for your content.

**Solution:**
1. Complete the lab using content analysis alone
2. Focus on comparing your content with current top-ranking content
3. Analyze content quality, currency, and structure
4. Performance data is helpful but not required—content analysis is sufficient

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The lab can be completed entirely through content analysis. GSC is optional and helpful but not mandatory.

---

### Issue: I'm not sure if content should be updated or replaced

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about the Update vs Replace decision.

**Solution:**
1. Review the decision framework from Day 5 Chapter 2
2. Ask: Can strategic updates address the issues? (If yes → Update)
3. Ask: Is the topic fundamentally outdated? (If yes → Replace)
4. Ask: Is the structure fixable? (If yes → Update, if no → Replace)
5. When in doubt, lean toward Update (preserves existing value)

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Document your uncertainty and reasoning. The learning objective is understanding the framework, not making perfect decisions. Explain your thought process.

---

### Issue: I can't identify specific decay factors

**Symptoms:**
You're not sure what decay factors to look for.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 5 Chapter 2 for decay factor categories:
   - Competition improvements
   - Outdated information
   - Algorithm misalignment
   - Evolving user expectations
2. For each category, ask specific questions:
   - Competition: Are top results better than your content?
   - Currency: Is information still accurate?
   - Algorithm: Does content meet current SEO standards?
   - Expectations: Does content meet current user needs?
3. Document what you find, even if it's "no issues found"

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on one decay factor category at a time. Start with information currency (easiest to assess), then move to others.
