You're having trouble finding update timeline information.

**Solution:**
1. Review Google Search Central for official update announcements
2. Check SEO industry update tracking resources
3. Use provided update timeline resources from course materials
4. Focus on major updates (core updates are most significant)
5. When in doubt, document the updates you can find

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The lab can be completed with general update knowledge. Focus on understanding the correlation framework conceptually.

---

### Issue: I can't determine if traffic drops correlate with updates

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about correlation between drops and updates.

**Solution:**
