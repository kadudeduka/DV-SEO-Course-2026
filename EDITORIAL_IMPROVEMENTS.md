## Bold Formatting Guidelines

### When to Use Bold
Use bold formatting to highlight key points that readers should remember:

1. **Critical principles and concepts** - Core ideas that form the foundation
2. **Key definitions** - Important terms and their meanings
3. **Action items** - What readers should do
4. **Warnings and cautions** - Critical mistakes to avoid
5. **Key takeaways** - Main points to remember
6. **Contrasting ideas** - Myths vs realities, old vs new approaches
7. **Important phrases** - Sentences that summarize key concepts

### Bold Formatting Best Practices
1. **Don't overuse bold** - Too much bold reduces impact; use strategically
2. **Bold complete thoughts** - Bold phrases or sentences, not random words
3. **Use for scanning** - Bold should help readers quickly identify important points
4. **Maintain readability** - Bold should enhance, not distract from the flow
5. **Be consistent** - Use bold for similar types of content throughout

### Examples of Effective Bold Usage

**Good:**
- "SEO is **a long-term investment**. Building genuine alignment **takes time—typically months, not days**."
- "**Content that tries to game the system fails.**"
- "**The fundamentals—aligning content with user intent—remain constant.**"

**Avoid:**
- Over-bolding: "SEO is **a** long-term **investment** that **requires** patience."
- Bolding obvious words: "SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**."

## Editorial Best Practices

### Content Enhancement
1. **Add callouts strategically** - Not every paragraph needs a callout, but key concepts, warnings, and tips should be highlighted
2. **Use variety** - Mix different callout types to keep content engaging
3. **Keep callouts concise** - Aim for 2-4 sentences per callout
4. **Place callouts strategically** - Position them immediately after the relevant content
5. **Combine bold with callouts** - Use bold for emphasis within paragraphs, callouts for extended explanations

### Formatting Guidelines
1. **Consistent emoji usage** - Use the same emoji for the same callout type across all chapters
2. **Bold titles** - Make callout titles bold for visual distinction
3. **Clear separation** - Use blank lines before and after callouts
4. **Scannable structure** - Make callouts easy to spot when scanning

### Content Types to Enhance
1. **Definitions** - Add Key Concept callouts for important terms
2. **Misconceptions** - Add Warning or Common Mistake callouts
3. **Best practices** - Add Tip callouts for actionable advice
4. **Case studies** - Enhance with Real-World Example callouts
5. **Key takeaways** - Add Remember callouts to reinforce learning

> **SEO Definition:** SEO is a long-term, intent-driven visibility discipline that aligns content with how search engines solve user problems. This definition emphasizes three critical elements: (1) it's long-term—results compound over time, (2) it's intent-driven—you must understand what users actually want, and (3) it's about visibility—not just rankings, but presence across all SERP features.

- Maintain the conversational, accessible tone
- Use callouts to break up long text blocks
- Ensure callouts add value, not just decoration
