### Step 2: Analyze SERP Components for Each Keyword

**What to Do:**
For each keyword, perform a Google search and systematically identify all SERP components:
1. Go to Google Search
2. Enter your keyword
3. Scroll through the entire first page
4. Identify all components: organic results, ads, featured snippets, People Also Ask, images, videos, local pack, knowledge panels, related searches
5. Document what appears and where

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed SERPs for all keywords
- [ ] You have identified all components for each keyword
- [ ] You have documented your observations in the Submission Template

---

### Step 3: Analyze Content Types That Rank

**What to Do:**
For each keyword, analyze what content types rank in organic results:
1. Review the top 10 organic results
2. Identify the content type of each result (blog post, product page, category page, landing page, etc.)
3. Note which content types dominate
4. Document patterns in content types

**Tool to Use:**
Google Search (reviewing organic results)

**What to Record:**
Record your analysis in the Submission Template, Section 3:
- For each keyword, list content types that rank
- Note which content types dominate
- Document patterns observed

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have analyzed content types for all keywords
- [ ] You have identified dominant content types
- [ ] You have documented your analysis in the Submission Template

---

### Step 4: Identify Intent Signals from SERP Composition

**What to Do:**
For each keyword, analyze how SERP composition signals intent:
1. Review SERP components present
2. Review content types that rank
3. Consider what these signals indicate about user intent
4. Document intent signals for each keyword

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your SERP analysis.

**What to Record:**
Record your intent signal analysis in the Submission Template, Section 4:
- For each keyword, document intent signals from SERP composition
- Explain how components and content types signal intent
- Note patterns across keywords

**Checkpoint:**
You've completed this step when:
- [ ] You have identified intent signals for all keywords
- [ ] You have documented how SERP composition signals intent
- [ ] You have recorded your analysis in the Submission Template

---

### Step 5: Validate Intent for Each Keyword

**What to Do:**
Based on your SERP analysis, validate the intent for each keyword:
1. Review your initial intent assumption
2. Compare it to SERP evidence (components, content types)
3. Validate or correct your assumption based on evidence
4. Document validated intent with supporting evidence

**Tool to Use:**
No specific tool—use your SERP analysis.

**What to Record:**
Record your intent validation in the Submission Template, Section 5:

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't identify intent signals

**Solution:**
- Focus on what content types rank (this is the strongest signal)
- Consider what SERP features appear
- Review Chapter 1 for intent signal guidelines
- Look for patterns across multiple keywords

### Issue: Initial assumption was wrong

**Solution:**
- This is expected and valuable learning
- Document how SERP analysis corrected your assumption
- Note what you learned from the correction
- This demonstrates why SERP validation matters

### Issue: Can't create a framework

**Solution:**
- Start by identifying common patterns you observed
- Group SERP signals by intent type
- Use examples from your analysis
- Keep it simple—a framework doesn't need to be complex
