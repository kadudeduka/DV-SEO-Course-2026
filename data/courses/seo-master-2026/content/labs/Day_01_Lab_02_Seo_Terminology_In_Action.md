- A client who wants to understand what you're doing
- A colleague from another department

Your explanation should:
- Avoid technical jargon
- Use simple analogies

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Find a Term in Google Search Central

**Symptoms:**
You search Google Search Central but can't find an official definition for a specific term.

**Solution:**
- Some terms may be explained in context rather than having dedicated pages
- Try searching for related concepts (e.g., search for "how Google discovers pages" instead of just "crawl")
- Look in the documentation index or use the site search function
- Check if the term is explained as part of a larger concept

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Use your chapter readings to provide a definition
- Note in the Submission Template that you couldn't find an official definition
- Your understanding from chapters is still valid

---

### Issue: Can't Find a Real Example for a Term

**Symptoms:**
You're unsure how to demonstrate a concept like "impressions" or "CTR" using Google Search.

**Solution:**
- For abstract concepts (impressions, CTR), search for information about them or examples of how they're used
- For concrete concepts (SERP, featured snippet), perform searches to observe them directly
- Remember: finding information about a concept is also a valid example
- Use screenshots of search results that discuss or demonstrate the concept

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Describe how the concept would appear in professional tools (even if you don't have access)
- Use your chapter readings to explain what the example would look like
- Focus on understanding the concept, not finding the perfect example

---

### Issue: Stakeholder Explanation Is Too Technical

**Symptoms:**
Your explanation still uses SEO jargon or technical language.

**Solution:**
- Replace technical terms with everyday language
- Use analogies (e.g., "crawling is like a librarian visiting every book in a library")
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Ask yourself: "Would my grandmother understand this?"
- Read your explanation out loud—if it sounds too technical, simplify it

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Start with: "In simple terms..." or "Think of it like..."
- Break complex concepts into smaller parts
- Use examples from everyday life
- Remember: clarity is more important than technical accuracy for stakeholders

---

### Issue: Submission Template Sections Don't Match Lab Steps

**Symptoms:**
You're unsure which Submission Template section corresponds to which lab step.

**Solution:**
- Review the Submission Template structure
- Lab steps explicitly reference Submission Template sections
- Section 1 is for terminology mapping table (definitions, examples, connections)
- Section 2 is for example documentation (screenshots, links)
- Section 3 is for Google Search Central references
- Section 4 is for stakeholder explanation

**If This Doesn't Work:**
- Record your work in the most appropriate section
- You can add notes explaining where information is located
- Contact your instructor if you need clarification
