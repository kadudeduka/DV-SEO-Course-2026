### Step 5: Identify Potential Root Causes

**What to Do:**
Identify potential root causes based on data analysis:

1. **Analyze drop patterns for causes:**
   - **Sudden drops:** May indicate technical issues, penalties, or algorithm updates
   - **Gradual declines:** May indicate content quality issues, competitive changes, or authority erosion
   - **Site-wide drops:** May indicate technical issues, penalties, or algorithm updates
   - **Isolated drops:** May indicate content issues, ranking competition, or page-specific problems

2. **Consider potential causes:**
   - Technical issues (crawl errors, indexation problems, site structure issues)
   - Content issues (quality problems, content decay, relevance issues)
   - Authority issues (link profile problems, trust issues)
   - Algorithmic issues (algorithm updates, penalties)
   - Competitive changes (competitors improving)

3. **Prioritize potential causes:**
   - Based on drop patterns, which causes are most likely?
   - Which causes explain the data best?
   - Which causes require immediate investigation?

4. **Document root cause analysis:**
   - Record potential root causes identified
   - Note reasoning for each potential cause
   - Prioritize causes by likelihood
   - Document cause analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: I don't have Google Search Console access

**Symptoms:**
You can't access GSC for traffic data.

**Solution:**
1. Use provided sample traffic data from course materials
2. Focus on understanding the diagnostic framework
3. Note that GSC would provide additional insights
4. Document that sample data was used

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The lab can be completed using sample data. GSC is helpful but not required—sample data is sufficient for learning diagnostic frameworks.

---

### Issue: I can't identify patterns in the data

**Symptoms:**
You're having trouble identifying patterns or correlations.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 15 Chapter 1 for pattern identification guidance
2. Look for timing correlations (when did drops occur?)
3. Compare traffic and ranking changes side-by-side
4. Look for sudden vs gradual patterns
5. When in doubt, document what you observe

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the diagnostic framework conceptually. The learning is in the diagnostic process, not perfect pattern identification.

---

### Issue: I'm not sure how to identify root causes

**Symptoms:**
You're uncertain about what constitutes a root cause.

**Solution:**
1. Review Day 15 Chapter 1 for root cause identification guidance
2. Consider drop patterns (sudden vs gradual suggests different causes)
3. Consider affected areas (site-wide vs isolated suggests different causes)
4. Review potential cause categories (technical, content, authority, algorithmic)
5. When in doubt, document your reasoning

**If This Doesn't Work:**
Focus on understanding the root cause identification framework conceptually. The learning is in the diagnostic process, not perfect root cause identification.
