1. Use provided competitor link data from course materials
2. Use free backlink checkers with limited functionality
3. Focus on understanding opportunity identification frameworks
4. Document that sample data was used

**If This Doesn't Work:**
The lab can be completed using Google Search and provided data. Ahrefs is helpful but not required—opportunity identification can be done through research and analysis.

### Issue: I can't find good competitors

**Symptoms:**
You're having trouble identifying relevant competitors.

**Solution:**
1. Search for your target website's main keywords
